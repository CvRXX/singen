# This config configures the singen tool. Every section is an function added to some channel(s). The section names ([name]) should be unique but could have any name except for the general one.



### This section sets the general properties of the file ###
[general]

#The number of bits in each sample
bits = 16

#The Sample rate in hz
rate = 44100

#The length of the file in seconds
length = 60

#The amount of audio channels that are generated
channels = 2



### The sinwave for channel 1 without a shift ###
[sinwave1]

#The type of function that is added to the channel
type = sinwave

#The channels that the function is applied to
channels = 1

#The frequency of the wave in hz
frequency = 240.0

#The amplitude of the wave
amplitude = 0.5

#The relative shift of the wave
shift = 0



### The sinwave for channel 1 without a shift ###
[sinwave2]

#The type of function that is added to the channel
type = sinwave

#The channels that the function is applied to
channels = 2

#The frequency of the wave in hz
frequency = 240.0

#The amplitude of the wave
amplitude = 0.5

#The relative shift of the wave. In this case "0.3" which means 0.3 times the period shifted. So the wave is shifted 1/3 of the period.
shift = 0.3



### The noise added two both channels. It will be the same noise.
[noise1]

#Defining that this function is a noise generator
type = white_noise

#The channels that the function is applied to
channels = 1,2

#The amplitude of the noise
amplitude = 0.5

#The seed of the noise. This is just a random number.
seed = 1243254
